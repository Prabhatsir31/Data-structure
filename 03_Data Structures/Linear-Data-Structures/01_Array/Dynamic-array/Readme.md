# Dynamic arrays

> on the other hand, can change their size during runtime. This is accomplished through the use of `pointers` and memory allocation techniques such as `new` and `delete`.

## Advantages of dynamic arrays

- They can change size at `runtime`, allowing for more flexibility in the use of memory.
- They can be resized easily, allowing for the addition or removal of elements as needed.

## Disadvantages of dynamic arrays

- They can be slower than `static arrays` due to the overhead of allocating and deallocating memory at `runtime`.
- They are prone to `memory leaks` if not managed properly, leading to poor performance and stability issues.
