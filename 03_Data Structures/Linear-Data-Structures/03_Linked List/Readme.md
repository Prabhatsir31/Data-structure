# Linked List
> A `linked list` is a `data structure` that consists of a sequence of `nodes`, where each node contains a value and a `reference` to the next node in the list. The first node is called the `head` and the last node is called the `tail`

## Linked List Vs Arrays
`Linked lists` and `arrays` are both `data structures` used to store and organize data, but they have distinct differences.
-  Arrays are a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations with a fixed size, providing constant time access using index but with time-consuming insertion and deletion operations.
 - On the other hand, `linked lists` are `dynamic`, with `nodes` containing values and `references` to the next node, allowing efficient insertion and deletion operations but with **slower access** to specific elements.
 - In summary, `arrays` are better for situations where indexed access and **fixed size** are important, while `linked lists` are better for situations where **dynamic size** and efficient insertion and deletion are important.`
